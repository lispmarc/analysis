I'm trying to prove exercise 113Y(b) of Measure Theory from Fremlin (see
https://www1.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/chap11.pdf page 39).

Given a measure space $\left( X, \sum, \mu \right)$ and $D \subseteq X$ prove
that $\sum_D = \left\{ E \bigcap D|E \in \sum \right\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra
of subsets of $D$ and that $\mu_D$ defined by $\mu_D (A) = \inf \left\{ \mu
(E) |E \in \sum, A \subseteq E \right\}$ is a measure on $\sum_D$. I have
already proved that $\Sigma_D$ is a $\sigma$-algebra and that $\mu^{\ast} :
\mathcal{P} (X) \rightarrow [0, \infty]$ defined by $\mu^{\ast} (A) = \inf
\left\{ \mu (E) |E \in \sum, A \subseteq E \right\}$ is a outer-measure such
that $\forall A \in \mathcal{P} (X)$ there exists a $E \in \sum$ with $\mu (A)
= \mu^{\ast} (A)$ (exercise 113Y(a)). I want then to apply the Caratheodory
theorem for the rest of the proof and must then show that $\sum_D \subseteq
\left\{ E \subseteq X| \forall A \subseteq X \tmop{we} \tmop{have} \mu^{\ast}
\left( A \bigcap E \right) + \mu^{\ast} (A\backslash E) \leqslant \mu^{\ast}
(A) \right\}$ but fails to do so. Also is this the correct way to solve the
exercise?

Any help in the last part is appreciated
