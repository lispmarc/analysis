# Contains the TexMacs files for my analysis book. 
## This is a book I'm writing to reflect my understanding of many aspects of abstact analysis. This is not a text book, so it does not contains exercises. However in contrast with text books I have added proofs for every theorem, proposition, lemma, etc. instead of leaving the proofs as a exericse or saying that the proof is trivial.
